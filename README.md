# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic-Tac-Toe game made with Python!

Instructions:
- Please open the Tic_Tac_Toe.ipynb file with a Jupyter Notebook
- In the same page as the opened Tic_Tac_Toe.ipynb game file and under the Kernal tab, click on "Restart and Run All" button to start the game
- When the game is concluded, there is the option to play again or end the game


Coding Notes:
- 'moves' is a global variable and is used 
- The "assign" function may accept upper or lower case inputs from the players
- The "extent" function passes a True or False to test if the user input is within range
- The "empty" function passes a True or False to test if there is a mark on the selected space
- The "win" function will also print out which key holds the winning combonation in the w_combos dictionary
- The "again" function holds a recursive start call if a player wants to play again and will reset the global 'moves' variable
